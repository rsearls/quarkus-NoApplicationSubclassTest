Debugging
Set a breakpoint at following
  RootClassNode line 67   ;; here you will see the resource path "/hello" is
                          ;; being registered

  SynchronousDispatcher line 323  ;; here you will see request is of type
                          ;; VertexHttpRequest.  In this obj the value of
                          ;; uri.path is "/myresources/hello" but it should be
                          ;; "/hello"
